groovy-quine
============
A repository for my playing with writing [quines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) in Groovy.

It includes a shell script which I used to test my code as I wrote, and a couple of quines that I made.

I wrote an accompanying blog post, "[Quines](http://dnahodil.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/quines/)".
